## Overview

Retro Chess is a complete implementation of chess with a retro-themed UI. It allows two players to play chess in real-time, with all standard chess rules enforced. The application uses Phoenix LiveView for real-time updates without needing WebSockets code or JavaScript.

## Features

- ‚ôüÔ∏è Full implementation of chess rules:
  - Standard piece movements for all pieces
  - Castling (kingside and queenside)
  - En passant captures
  - Pawn promotion
  - Check and checkmate detection
  - Stalemate detection
  - Draws due to insufficient material or fifty-move rule

- üéÆ Retro-style interface:
  - Pixel art styling with "Press Start 2P" font
  - Responsive board that works on both desktop and mobile
  - Visual highlighting of valid moves and checks

- üë• Multiplayer capabilities:
  - Quick game creation and joining
  - Share a URL to invite opponents
  - Spectator mode for watching games
  - Auto-assignment of colors

- ‚ö° Technical features:
  - Real-time updates using Phoenix LiveView
  - Fault-tolerant architecture using Elixir processes
  - Comprehensive test suite
  - Docker support for easy deployment

## Technology Stack

- **Elixir**: Functional programming language
- **Phoenix Framework**: Web framework
- **Phoenix LiveView**: Real-time UI updates without JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for game persistence
- **Docker**: Containerization

## Architecture

The application follows a clean, modular architecture:

- **Board**: Core representation of a chess board and pieces
- **MoveValidator**: Validates moves according to chess rules
- **GameServer**: Manages game state and player interactions
- **LiveView**: Handles the UI and real-time updates

The game logic is completely isolated from the UI, making it easy to test and maintain.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gooeytuxedo/chess-elixir.git
   cd chess_app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mix deps.get
   ```

3. Setup the database:
   ```bash
   mix ecto.setup
   ```

4. Start the Phoenix server:
   ```bash
   mix phx.server
   ```

Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

### Using Docker

1. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
